# Warm Up: Predict Blood Donations
[Dataset](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations/data/) is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We need to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.

We explored the dataset, reviewed few jupyter notebooks and did feature addition to the dataset. Then applied Logistic Regression from sklearn to get the following result.
